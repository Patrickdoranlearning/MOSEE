Future works:
- asset light factor
- use volatility to determine the speed of returns
- minimise the amount you pay per dollar, maximise volatility

The plan to make it more efficient:

There are some companies we do not care about at all:
- Russian companies
- If a company is Chinese AND a bank
- If Pad value is less than half Market Cap - check 
- If any company has PAD mos of greater than 1
  - I want to buy companies with a high PAD mos 
  - the PAD mos tells you how much you can expect to receive based on a 1$ investment
  - eg. if PAD mos is 17, then you spend 17$ and receive a 1$ value

- will need to add market_currency and financial_currency

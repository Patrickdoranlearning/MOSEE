Mosee: 
- Is a simple stock screener which is looking for value stocks
- It calculates intrinsic values using net income projections
- It also takes into account the earnings to equity of a company
- The higher the earnings to equity, the more money returned per euro invested
- 

Future works:
- Asset light factor
- Look at different valuation models for different sectors (banks discounted dividend models)
- look into the money spent in stock buy backs? Is this a good use of investor capital?
- What percent of the company will I own at this level of buy backs in 5 years?
- Do buy backs represent a large percentage of volume? or market capitalisation?
- Is the buyback creating value or destroying value?
- use volatility to determine the speed of returns
- minimise the amount you pay per dollar, maximise volatility

The plan to make it more efficient:

There are some companies we do not care about at all:
- Russian companies
- If a company is Chinese AND a bank
- If Pad value is less than half Market Cap - check 
- If any company has PAD mos of greater than 1
  - I want to buy companies with a high PAD mos 
  - the PAD mos tells you how much you can expect to receive based on a 1$ investment
  - eg. if PAD mos is 17, then you spend 17$ and receive a 1$ value
